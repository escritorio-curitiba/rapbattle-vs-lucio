# rapbattle-vs-lucio

Towards Lucio, Copel's chatbot, a new challenger is approaching.

The purpose of this program is to use Python libraries to find out what Lucio is saying and respond to it, with the aim of finding out the Light situation of all of the houses.

The goal would be to save all the files to a Google sheet where they are accessable from the cloud, so I can run this script on a laptop and get real work done on the big computer.
